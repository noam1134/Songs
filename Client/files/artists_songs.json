I'm putting on a show  \r\nIn the magazines, hear me on the radio  \r\nSo what do you think huh?  \r\n(Well I hope that your proud now, to watch it all go down)  \r\nI'm sorry daddy you didn't get to watch me grow  \r\nNow I'm always on the road no time to say hello  \r\nBye (and I hope that your proud now, to watch it all go down)  \r\n  \r\nYeah mamma you look great, perfect  \r\nBe safe on your first date, for certain  \r\nIf he brings you home too late, I'll hurt him  \r\nDon't worry bout me I'm safe I'll close the curtains  \r\nAnd I feel like I'm raising you but what do I know baby blue  \r\nAll I know is that I was made in you so I put all my faith in you  \r\nYeah I was only ten but I felt like a man and I had to let you go  \r\nAll I wanted was for us to be rich tear drops in my cereal bowl  \r\nSo I turned into an asshole young and dumb smoking weed  \r\nVandalizing, robbing houses, stealing cars, that was me  \r\nBut everything I did I had to see  \r\nFeel the pain, had to grieve  \r\nTo become who I am and I'm proud of the man I came to be  \r\nWhat I've learned cannot be taught  \r\nWhat I've earned cannot be bought  \r\nJustified deserve it all  \r\nSo don't be concerned it's not your fault  \r\nI never counted sheep I count my blessings  \r\nSo if you see him now momma don't give him the cold shoulder just give him my\r\nmessage just tell him  \r\n  \r\n[Chorus]\r\n\r\n"

It's only fair.  \r\n  \r\n[Verse 2]  \r\nHad married Geoffrey of Anjou,  \r\nStuck in France not Waterloo.  \r\nWhen Steve without a voulez vous,  \r\nTook throne from me.  \r\nShould be dancing queen.  \r\nOh stop causing such a scene!  \r\n  \r\n[Chorus]  \r\nGimme, gimme crown and take a chance on me,  \r\nI'm heir to the throne not you! Ah-ha!  \r\nThink you'll get it back,  \r\nNow that I'd like to see!  \r\n  \r\nOh, I do, I do, I do!  \r\n  \r\n[Verse 3]  \r\nFought in Lincoln,  \r\nShe caught me.  \r\nWas proclaimed first English Lady.  \r\nBut she made many enemies.  \r\nRemember me? I'm Stephens wife.  \r\n  \r\n[Verse 4]  \r\nMade royal councilors agree,  \r\nThat she lacked femininity.  \r\nTook Stephens army and besieged her.  \r\nEugh! More strife!  \r\n  \r\n[Verse 5]  \r\nI was trapped so faked my death!  \r\nHid in coffin, held my breath.  \r\nEscaped!  \r\nYou think that I'm impressed?  \r\nWell I'm not.  \r\nJust look who I've got,  \r\nYour half brother, want to swap?  \r\n  \r\n[Chorus]  \r\nGimme, gimme hubby and we'll fight again.  \r\nThe winner takes it all. Ah-ha!  \r\nIn Oxford I'll besiege,  \r\nAnd I'll escape and then,  \r\nI'll join the battle call.  \r\n  \r\n[Verse 6]  \r\nAge 14, I fought but lost,  \r\nSo Uncle Stephen stayed as boss.  \r\nWho should be ruler, mamma? Mia!  \r\nHere we go again.  \r\n  \r\n[Verse 7]  \r\nSadly my darling Matilda,  \r\nCaught a fever and it killed her.  \r\nI gave up my dream  \r\nTo build a royal dynasty.  \r\nWhen my son died,  \r\nHad no heir which was a bind.  \r\n  \r\n[Chorus]  \r\nGimme, gimme crown 'cause next in line it's me.  \r\nYou can have it when I'm done. Ah-ha!  \r\nSo Empress Matilda never did make queen.  \r\nThe throne went to my son.  \r\n  \r\nKnowing Mum, knowing you.  \r\nEverybody happy? Good!\r\n\r\n"

Dolly (Platts?)  \r\nShe wasn't exactly what you'd call beauty,  \r\nBut she was the belle of our flats.  \r\nA whirlwind romance and Dolly took a (flier?)  \r\nWith Lawless she would settle down  \r\nIt was pure coincidence three months before  \r\nThere was a yankee destroyer in town.  \r\n  \r\nAnd the couple were blessed with one of god's miracles  \r\nBefore six months had elapsed  \r\nDolly gave birth to a nine-pound black baby  \r\nAnd Lawless was fit to collapse  \r\nShe swore she'd never been touched by another  \r\nAnd Lawless took her at her word,  \r\nAnd the neighbours exclaimed, 'he's the spit of his  \r\nFather, and the cuckoo is a wonderful bird. '  \r\n  \r\nOh now Lawless stays in and looks after his baby  \r\nWhile Dolly goes out for the night.  \r\nThe old gossips all say she's free in her ways  \r\nAnd their evil rumours ran rife.  \r\nWhen Lawless heard this he waited for Dolly  \r\nIn the bridge where the river runs low.  \r\nNoone will ever know what happened next,  \r\nBut Dolly drowned in the Dodder  \r\nBelow.  \r\n  \r\nSome say he's crazy and more say he's evil,  \r\nEveryone says that he's mad.  \r\nNoone will defend him, he was no angel,  \r\nBut I'll tell you he wasn't all bad.  \r\nThey've locked him away for the rest of his natural  \r\nNever again will he see  \r\nDown the back of Ring's End  \r\nThere's a lonely child playing  \r\nWhere the Liffey flows into the sea.  \r\n  \r\nChristy's comment  \r\n  \r\nBarney Rush was home and we organised a sing-song in  \r\nThe brought Mick Curry who sang this  \r\nSong.

Cause ah...  \r\nMusic, 45 King, music Latifah the Queen  \r\nMusic, domination to bring the world  \r\nIrie, say in the fire you will burn (Repeats to fade)\r\n\r\n"

Oh no, pretty maiden, that never\r\nshall be.  \r\nI've a wife down in London and children twice three,  \r\nTwo wives and the army's too many for me.  \r\n  \r\nWell, I'll go back to London and I'll stay there for a year,  \r\nIt's often that I'll think of you, my little dear.  \r\nAnd if ever I return it will be in the spring  \r\nJust to see the waters glide and hear the nightingale sing.  \r\nTo see the waters glide and hear the nightingale sing.\r\n\r\n"

Joy spread and  \r\nthe massage got home --  \r\n  \r\nSinging about the Valley of Sunsets ...  \r\nPurple and gold ... the Armies of the Lord  \r\nBefore ancient Egypt, there were moon trips ...  \r\nThe Valleys of Neptune is arising --  \r\n  \r\n3.  \r\n  \r\nLook out East coast, but you're  \r\ngonna have a neighbor,  \r\nA rebirth land ...  \r\nthe praying Burning Sands.  \r\n  \r\nWe know there were worlds  \r\nso much older ...  \r\nAnd they shall rise, and  \r\ntell us much more the truth of man --  \r\n  \r\n4.  \r\n  \r\nI see visions of sleeping peaks  \r\nerupting ...  \r\nreleasing all hell that  \r\nwill shake the Earth from end to end --  \r\nAnd this ain't bad news, good news,  \r\nor any news ... it's just the truth,  \r\nBetter save your souls while  \r\nyou can --  \r\n  \r\nSinging about the New Valleys  \r\nof the Sunrise ... Rainbow clean,  \r\nthe world is gonna be ...  \r\nSinging about getting ready for the new tide ...  \r\nThe Valleys of Neptune is arising.\r\n\r\n"

Pretty scary!  \r\n  \r\nNow, I'm liberal, but to a degree  \r\nI want ev'rybody to be free  \r\nBut if you think that I'll let Barry Goldwater  \r\nMove in next door and marry my daughter  \r\nYou must think I'm crazy!  \r\nI wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.  \r\n  \r\nWell, I set my monkey on the log  \r\nAnd ordered him to do the Dog  \r\nHe wagged his tail and shook his head  \r\nAnd he went and did the Cat instead  \r\nHe's a weird monkey, very funky.  \r\n  \r\nI sat with my high-heeled sneakers on  \r\nWaiting to play tennis in the noonday sun  \r\nI had my white shorts rolled up past my waist  \r\nAnd my wig-hat was falling in my face  \r\nBut they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.  \r\n  \r\nI gotta woman, she's so mean  \r\nShe sticks my boots in the washing machine  \r\nSticks me with buckshot when I'm nude  \r\nPuts bubblegum in my food  \r\nShe's funny, wants my money, calls me \"honey.\"  \r\n  \r\nNow I gotta friend who spends his life  \r\nStabbing my picture with a bowie-knife  \r\nDreams of strangling me with a scarf  \r\nWhen my name comes up he pretends to barf.  \r\nI've got a million friends!  \r\n  \r\nNow they asked me to read a poem  \r\nAt the sorority sister's home  \r\nI got knocked down and my head was swimmin'  \r\nI wound up with the Dean of Women  \r\nYippee! I'm a poet, and I know it.  \r\nHope I don't blow it.  \r\n  \r\nI'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange  \r\nSo I look like a walking mountain range  \r\nAnd I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse  \r\nOut to the country club and the golf course.  \r\nCarry the New York Times, shoot a few holes, blow their minds.  \r\n  \r\nNow you're probably wondering by now  \r\nJust what this song is all about  \r\nWhat's probably got you baffled more  \r\nIs what this thing here is for.  \r\nIt's nothing  \r\nIt's something I learned over in England.\r\n\r\n"
